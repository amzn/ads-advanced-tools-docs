# Amazon Ads API Postman collection

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a tool that allows developers to make API calls using a user interface. Postman can also store variables and perform basic automations that simplify API testing. 

Amazon Ads provides a Postman collection that includes commonly used API endpoints. The collection also includes pre- and post-request scripts to automate management of auth credentials.

Visit the [Amazon Ads advanced tools center](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/) for additional API documentation.
